        structure: SlashCommandBuilder | ContextMenuCommandBuilder,
      
        onCommand: async(client, interaction) => {

            await interaction.reply(`Button ${interaction.customId} used by ${interaction.user} !`);

        onEvent: async(client, ...args) => {
            await client.logger.log("info", `Event ${name} called !`);
        }
    },

    ... // More events
